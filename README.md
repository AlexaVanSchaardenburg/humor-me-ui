## Context
This project was completed during Mod 3 of Turing. The goal of this project was to learn and immplement a new technology. We chose to build a backend server (linked [here](https://github.com/rachelsoae/stretch-be)) to host our quotes, and images, as well as save any user favorited posters. We completed this project over the course of 12 days, including our planning, research and excecution phases.

## Wins and Challenges
The biggest challenge in this project was building a fully functional and deployed backend from scratch having never worked on a backend before. In order to accomplish this goal we used a project planning board to organize our research and coding in order to optimize the time we spent on various parts of the project. Communication was key, and we utilized daily stand ups and Slack messaging to keep all contributors on the same page. This was especially helpful during research so that we could share helpful resources, including videos and specific parts of the knex and express docs. 

Another win that we are extremely proud of is building a fully functional app where a user can view, generate, and create data. This was all done over the course of a week and a half in addition to other course work and lessons. This is a testament to how much we have learned in the last 4 months. 

## Future Extensions
Given more time on this porject or upon revisting this project, extensions include: 
- Allow a user to delete favorited posters
- Allow the user to filter favorites quotes by wholesome or chaotic
- Allow user created quotes and images to be added to the database and be generated randomly in the future.

Because building the backend was part of this project we would also need to add the appropriate endpoints in the server for all of the above extensions. Some already exsist, see the [back end README](https://github.com/rachelsoae/stretch-be) for existing endpoints.
