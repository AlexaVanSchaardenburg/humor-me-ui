## Context
This project was completed during Mod 3 of Turing. The goal of this project was to learn and immplement a new technology. We chose to build a backend server (linked [here](https://github.com/rachelsoae/stretch-be)) to host our quotes, and images, as well as save any user favorited posters.

## Technologies Used
Front End Tech Stack
- React.js
- React Router
- Cypress
- CSS

Back End Tech Stack
- Express.js
- Knex.js
- PostgreSQL

## Future Extensions
Given more time on this porject or upon revisting this project, extensions include: 
- Allow a user to delete favorited posters
- Allow the user to filter favorites quotes by wholesome or chaotic
- Allow user created quotes and images to be added to the database and be generated randomly in the future.

Because building the backend was part of this project we would also need to add the appropriate endpoints in the server for all of the above extensions. Some already exsist, see the [back end README](https://github.com/rachelsoae/stretch-be) for existing endpoints.
